# Details 
This repository is used for our first Data Engineering Assignment. It will be used as a template for future assignments of IDS 706. This repo contains the following: 



## The repository serves as a simple addition function
Description: This script demonstrates a basic Python program that performs addition using a function called add. The main() function initializes two variables, x and y, and uses the add() function to calculate their sum.

## How It Works
The script defines an add(x, y) function that takes two arguments and returns their sum.
The main() function initializes two integers (x = 1 and y = 2), calls the add() function with these values, and stores the result.
If the script is run as the main program, the main() function is executed.


# Some explanation and breakdown: 

[main.py](main.py)

Function: Main entry point of a project containing program. 

[requirements.txt](requirements.txt)

Function: This file lists all the Python dependencies required for the project. It specifies the exact versions of packages needed, making it easy to install all dependencies with a single command.

[hello.yml](.github/workflows/hello.yml)

Function: This file is typically used for workflows in CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) systems, like GitHub Actions. It defines automated processes, such as running tests, building the project, or deploying it when certain events occur.

[Makefile](Makefile)

Function: A Makefile is used to automate tasks in software development, especially compiling and building projects. It contains a set of rules defining how to execute commands for tasks like building, testing, or cleaning up files. This helps streamline repetitive commands.

[test.py](test.py)

Function: test.py is a script typically used to contain test cases for a project. It includes functions or classes designed to verify that the code works as expected.
